# suicide-data-analysis

Here, the data is from World Health Organization (WHO) from 1985 to 2016. the dataset has several attributes such as country, no. of suicides, age groups, gender, population etc. In this analysis, I've done exploratory data analysis using this dataset to discover the correlation among these features. Also, the visualization of this notebook presents us with some patterns to fully understand the analytical part.
